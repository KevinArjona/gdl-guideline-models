Superimposed preeclampsia is characterized by worsening or resistant hypertension (especially acutely), the new onset of proteinuria or a sudden increase in proteinuria, and/or significant new end-organ dysfunction in a patient with chronic hypertension. It typically occurs after 20 weeks of gestation or postpartum.\n\nDefinitions/diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia are generally similar worldwide except the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy definition also includes signs of uteroplacental dysfunction (eg, fetal growth restriction, abnormal angiogenic markers, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler, abruption, fetal demise)."}}}},"term_bindings":{}}}
