Distance walked (Distance_walked): actual distance walked by the individual in the ISWT. 2. 85% Predicted HR max (Pred_HR_Max): 85% of Maximum heart rate predicted by an equation for an individual based on their age. The test is supposed to be stopped when the person reaches this value as they have reached the maximum permissible limit of exercise for their age. Formula for predicted Maximum heart rate is 210-0.65*age (years) 3. Predicted ISWT Distance (Pred_Distance): This gives the distance that an individual is expected to walk on the ISWT based on their age, gender and body mass index. 4. VO2_Peak: This is the measure of exercise capacity of an individual and denotes the highest amount of oxygen consumed at peak exercise. In this archetype, the value of VO2 peak is predicted from the distance walked by the individual during the test. 5. Peak power output in watts ((Peak_Exc_Capacity): This denotes the ability of an individual perform maximal work in watts and is an important metrics used while prescribing","misuse":"1. The archetype should not be used to record values of any other exercise tests like the 6 minute walk test , treadmill test, etc. 2. The results obtained should always be correlated clinically. 3. The intention of creating this archetype was for its usage to record outcome measures obtained when the test is performed in adults with cardiac or pulmonary dysfunctions. While the archetype can be used in all patient groups who perform the standardized ISWT, the author requests caution."}},"other_details":{"references":"1.
